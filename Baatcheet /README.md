# Baatcheet-7b - Hinglish / English model Demo

Based on the pre-quantized Gemma-7B model, this model has been fine-tuned on the Gemma-7B base model for Hinglish/English translations and completions using QLoRA. The training data includes two datasets: fnnerd/Baatcheet_Hinglish_English_Translation_Corpus and findnitai/english-to-hinglish. This model, developed by L00ny Labs, has been open-sourced for research purposes. For commercial applications, please contact us, we might be able to provide more accurate models (details below).
